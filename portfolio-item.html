        <div class="project-detail-overview">
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">Over 10 weeks, I worked with three Stanford product engineers and designers to explore how to design for healthy behaviors in high-achievement environments. Through needfinding interviews and synthesis, we found that students and early-career professionals struggle to build essential interpersonal skills that are rarely taught or practiced intentionally. This insight led us to level up., a mobile app that breaks interpersonal skill-building into bite-sized experiences, using daily challenges, social motivation, and progress tracking to support career growth.</p>

        <div class="project-detail-overview">
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">Through two rounds of needfinding interviews, we spoke with six participants across diverse ages, careers, and stress contexts, including students, early-career professionals, individuals between jobs, and a domain expert psychologist. Participants were recruited through local coffee shops or mutual connections, participated voluntarily without compensation, and were interviewed using open-ended questions to surface authentic routines, behaviors, and sources of stress.</p>

        <div class="project-detail-overview">
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">To move from raw interviews to actionable insights, we translated our conversations into empathy maps for key personas.

                <li>Stress frequently showed up through physical or behavioral signals before participants consciously labeled themselves as stressed.</li>
                <li>Several participants expressed difficulty stepping off predefined paths (academic, career, or social) without feeling behind or at risk.</li>

We evaluated this through an experience prototype, focusing not on validating a polished product, but on observing whether users would take action when exploration felt low-stakes, concrete, and optional.</p>

        <div class="project-detail-overview">
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">We explored multiple concepts in parallel and selected one direction to prototype more deeply. The emphasis was on creating clear entry points, lightweight commitment, and visible progress, without forcing users into rigid flows. The low-fidelity designs focus on structure and intent, not visual polish.</p>

            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">We tested the low-fidelity prototype with 8 users to understand how they experienced the core flows, from discovering a task, to tracking personal progress, to interacting with others. Rather than focusing on speed or efficiency, we paid attention to where users hesitated, felt motivated, or disengaged as the experience became more complex. This helped us identify which parts of the experience felt encouraging and low-pressure, and where additional structure or clarity was needed to maintain engagement.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="project-detail-overview-title">Signals From User Testing</h2>
        <div class="project-detail-overview">
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">Testing surfaced a consistent pattern: users were more willing to engage when the experience felt inviting and self-paced. Confusion or visual density quickly increased friction, even when the underlying idea resonated.</p>
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">Social features worked best when they felt intentional and secondary to personal progress.</p>

        <div class="project-detail-overview">
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">These insights led us to simplify entry points, reduce initial choice overload, and separate social interaction from core progression. The design shifted toward guiding users through action first, with reflection and connection layered in afterward.</p>
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">This evolution helped align the interface with the original goal: making growth feel doable, not daunting.</p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="project-detail-overview-title">Design Iterations & Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
        <div class="project-detail-overview">
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">With validated assumptions and refined structure, we moved into high-fidelity design to explore how visual hierarchy, interaction patterns, and feedback could reinforce motivation without increasing pressure. The goal at this stage was not visual polish alone, but to ensure the interface supported clarity, momentum, and emotional ease.</p>
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">We completed two iterations of a high-fidelity prototype, using each round to address usability gaps uncovered through testing and critique. Early versions revealed friction around discoverability, task density, and unclear system feedback, even when users resonated with the concept itself.</p>

        <div class="project-detail-overview">
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">Between high-fidelity iterations, we conducted a systematic heuristic review across the entire product experience. Evaluating the design against established usability principles allowed us to step back from individual screens and identify broader patterns that could undermine trust or engagement.</p>
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">This review surfaced over 100 heuristic issues, clustered around:</p>
            <ul class="project-detail-overview-list">
                <li>unclear system status and feedback,</li>
                <li>inconsistent interaction patterns,</li>
                <li>cognitive overload in task lists,</li>
                <li>and misaligned affordances in social features.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="project-detail-overview-text">Rather than treating these as isolated fixes, we used them to guide a more holistic redesign in the second iteration.</p>
